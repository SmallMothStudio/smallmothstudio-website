            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Welcome I am SmallMoth, I run an indie game studio driven by a passion for creating immersive, narrative-driven games. As a solo developer, I am currently working on two projects that promise to bring unique experiences to the gaming community:

                * Lumina's Labyrinth: Embark on a Metroidvania adventure with Lumina, a valiant silk moth, as she endeavors to save her species from extinction. Explore rich environments, solve challenging puzzles, and outsmart predators in her quest to protect her kin.

                * [Unnamed Game]: Dive into the chaos of a peaceful kingdom turned upside down by a mysterious blob. Control the blob, uncover its secrets, and explore the depth of its untold story.
My current goal is to release at least one of these games by mid to late 2025. Additionally, I am excited to attend the Game Developers Conference (GDC) next year. This opportunity will allow me to share my work, connect with fellow game developers, and draw inspiration from the vibrant community present at the event.
Stay tuned for more updates, exclusive sneak peeks, and a behind-the-scenes look at the creative process behind these exciting titles!</p>
